### All-Points Bulletin

I need your help. We need to find a newer version of the source code for
this driver. While working on source code for other more recent drivers I
have noticed indications that Realtek may still working on this 8814au
driver. I have not been able to locate a newer version. This driver is
v5.8.5.1 dated 20191029. It is getting hard to maintain and does not have
many of the features that other, more modern drivers do. If we can find a
driver for the 8814au that is up to date, we can make better use of our
8814au adapters. A newer driver should have version numbers of 5.12.x,
5.13.x or higher. Please search all locations that might have a new version
available. Ask retailers. Please help.

### Installation Information

Warning: Installing multiple drivers for the same hardware usually does
not end well. If a previous attempt to install this driver failed or if
you have previously installed another driver for chipsets supported by
this driver, you MUST remove anything that the previous attempt
installed BEFORE attempting to install this driver. This driver can be
removed with the script called `./remove-driver.sh`. Information is
available in the section called `Removal of the Driver.` You can get a
good idea as to whether you need to remove a previously installed
driver by running the following command:

```
sudo dkms status
```

Warning: If you decide to upgrade to a new version of kernel such as 5.18 to 5.19, you
need to remove the driver you have installed and install the newest available before
installing the new kernel. Use the following commands in the driver directory:

```
$ sudo ./remove-driver.sh
$ git pull
$ sudo ./install-driver.sh
```

Temporary internet access is required for installation. There are numerous ways
to enable temporary internet access depending on your hardware and situation.
[One method is to use tethering from a phone.](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-tether-your-smartphone-in-linux).
Another method is to keep a [WiFi adapter that uses an in-kernel driver](https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi) in your toolkit.

You will need to use the terminal interface. The quick way to open a terminal:
Ctrl+Alt+T (hold down on the Ctrl and Alt keys then press the T key).

An alternative terminal is to use SSH (Secure Shell) from the same or from
another computer, in which case you will be in a suitable terminal after logging
in, but this step requires that an SSH daemon/server has already been
configured. (There are lots of SSH guides available, e.g., for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#setting-up-an-ssh-server) and for [Ubuntu](https://linuxconfig.org/ubuntu-20-04-ssh-server). Do not forget [to secure the SSH server](https://www.howtogeek.com/443156/the-best-ways-to-secure-your-ssh-server/).)

You will need to have sufficient access rights to use `sudo` so that commands
can be executed as the `root` user. (If the command `sudo echo Yes` returns
"Yes", with or without having to enter your password, you do have sufficient
access rights.)

DKMS is used for the installation. DKMS is a system utility which will
automatically recompile and reinstall this driver when a new kernel is
installed. DKMS is provided by and maintained by Dell.

It is recommended that you do not delete the driver directory after installation
as the directory contains information and scripts that you may need in the future.

Secure mode: The primary installation script, `install-driver.sh`, will support
secure mode... if your distro supports the method dkms uses. I regularly test the
installation script on systems with secure mode on. It works very well on Ubuntu based
distros. Some distros, such as Raspberry Pi OS, do not support secure mode because the
hardware they support does not support secure mode making it unnecessary. There are
distros that do not work with the support currently in use. If you install this driver
and, after a reboot, the driver is not working, you can go into the BIOS and temporarily
turn secure mode off to see if secure mode is the problem.

### Installation Steps

Note: The installation instructions are for the novice user. Experienced users are
welcome to alter the installation to meet their needs. Support will be provided based
on the steps below.

#### Step 1: Open a terminal (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+T)

#### Step 2: Update and upgrade system packages (select the option for the OS you are using)

Note: If your Linux distro does not fall into one of options listed
below, you will need to research how to update and upgrade your system
packages.

- Option for Debian based distributions such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Kali and Raspberry Pi OS

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

- Option for Arch based distributions such as Manjaro

```
sudo pacman -Syu
```

- Option for Fedora based distributions

```
sudo dnf upgrade
```

- Option for openSUSE based distributions

```
sudo zypper update
```

Note: It is recommended that you reboot your system at this point. The
rest of the installation will appreciate having a fully up to date
system to work with. The installation can then be continued with Step 3.

```
sudo reboot
```

#### Step 3: Install the required packages (select the option for the OS you are using)

- Option for Raspberry Pi OS (ARM/ARM64)

```
sudo apt install -y raspberrypi-kernel-headers build-essential bc dkms git
```

- Option for Debian, Kali, and Raspberry Pi Desktop (x86)

```
sudo apt install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential bc dkms git libelf-dev
```

- Option for Ubuntu (all flavors)

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms git 
```

- Option for Fedora

```
sudo dnf -y install kernel-devel kernel-debug-devel dkms git 
```

- Option for openSUSE

```
sudo zypper install -t pattern devel_kernel dkms
```

- Option for Solus

```
sudo eopkg install gcc linux-current-headers make git binutils
```

- Options for Arch and Manjaro

If using pacman

```
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm linux-headers dkms git
```

Note: If you are asked to choose a provider, make sure to choose the one
that corresponds to your version of the linux kernel (for example,
"linux510-headers" for Linux kernel version 5.10). If you install the
incorrect version, you'll have to uninstall it and install the correct
version.

If using other methods, please follow the instructions provided by those
methods.

#### Step 4: Create a directory to hold the downloaded driver

```
mkdir -p ~/src
```

#### Step 5: Move to the newly created directory

```
cd ~/src
```

#### Step 6: Download the driver

```
git clone https://github.com/morrownr/8814au.git
```

#### Step 7: Move to the newly created driver directory

```
cd ~/src/8814au
```

#### Step 8: Run a script to reconfigure for ARM or ARM64 based systems

Warning: This driver defaults to supporting x86 and amd64 based systems
and this step should be `skipped` if your system is powered by an x86, 
amd64 or compatible CPU.

Note: If your system is powered by an ARM or ARM64 based Raspberry Pi,
then one of the following scripts should be executed:

- Option for the following listed operating systems to be installed to
Raspberry Pi hardware

```
       * Raspberry Pi OS (32 bit)
```

```
./ARM_RPI.sh
```

- Option for the following listed operating systems to be installed to
Raspberry Pi hardware

```
       * Raspberry Pi OS (64 bit)
       * Kali Linux RPI ARM64
       * Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi
```

```
./ARM64_RPI.sh
```

Note: ARM or ARM64 based systems not listed above will likely require
modifications similar to those provided in the above scripts but the
number and variety of different ARM and ARM64 based systems makes
supporting each system unpractical so you will need to research the
needs of your system and make the appropriate modifications. If you
discover the settings and make a new script that works with your ARM or
ARM64 based system, you are welcome to submit the script and information
to be included here.

#### Step 10: Run the installation script ( install-driver.sh )

Note: Solus Linux does not support dkms and will require a manual build.
See `Manual build instructions` below.

Note: For automated builds, use _NoPrompt_ as an option.

```
sudo ./install-driver.sh
```

Note: If you elect to skip the reboot at the end of the installation
script, the driver may not load immediately and the driver options will
not be applied. Rebooting is strongly recommended.

Manual build instructions: The script `install-driver.sh` automates the
installation process, however, it may be necessary to build and install
the driver manually with some Linux distros:

```
make clean
make
sudo make install
sudo reboot
```

Note: If you use the manual build instructions, you will need to repeat
the process each time a new kernel is installed in your distro.

-----

### Driver Options ( edit-options.sh )

A file called `8814au.conf` will be installed in `/etc/modprobe.d` by
default.

Note: The installation script will prompt you to edit the options.

Location: `/etc/modprobe.d/8814au.conf`

This file will be read and applied to the driver on each system boot.

To edit the driver options file, run the `edit-options.sh` script

```
sudo ./edit-options.sh
```

Note: Documentation for Driver Options is included in the file `8814au.conf`.

-----

### Removal of the Driver ( remove-driver.sh )

Note: This script should be used in the following situations:

- if driver installation fails
- if the driver is no longer needed
- if a new or updated version of the driver needs to be installed
- if a distro version upgrade is going to be installed

Note: This script removes everything that has been installed, with the
exception of the packages installed in Step 3 and the driver directory.
The driver directory can be deleted after running this script.

#### Step 1: Open a terminal (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+T)

#### Step 2: Move to the driver directory

```
cd ~/src/8814au
```

#### Step 3: Run the removal script

```
sudo ./remove-driver.sh
```

### Recommended WiFi Router/ Access Point Settings

Note: These are general recommendations, some of which may not apply to your specific situation.

- Security: Set WPA2-AES. Do not set WPA2 mixed mode or WPA or TKIP.

- Channel width for 2.4 GHz: Set 20 MHz fixed width. Do not use 40 MHz or 20/40 automatic.

- Channels for 2.4 GHz: Set channel 1 or 6 or 11 depending on the congestion at your location. Do not set automatic channel selection. As time passes, if you notice poor performance, recheck congestion and set channel appropriately. The environment around you can and does change over time.

- Mode for 2.4 GHz: For best performance, set "N only" if you no longer use B or G capable devices.

- Network names: Do not set the 2.4 GHz Network and the 5 GHz Network to the same name. Note: Unfortunately many routers come with both networks set to the same name. You need to be able to control which network that is in use so changing the name of one of the networks is recommended. Since many IoT devices use the 2.4 GHz network, it may be better to change the name of the 5 GHz network.

- Channels for 5 GHz: Not all devices are capable of using DFS channels (I'm looking at you Roku.) It may be necessary to set a fixed channel in the range of 36 to 48 or 149 to 165 in order for all of your devices to work on 5 GHz. (For US, other countries may vary.)

- Best location for the WiFi router/access point: Near center of apartment or house, at least a couple of feet away from walls, in an elevated location. You may have to test to see what the best location is in your environment.

- Check congestion: There are apps available for smart phones that allow you to check the congestion levels on WiFi channels. The apps generally go by the name of ```WiFi Analyzer``` or something similar.

After making and saving changes, reboot the router.

### Check and set regulatory domain

Check the current setting

```
sudo iw reg get
```

If you get 00, that is the default and may not provide optimal performance.

Find the correct setting here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2

Set it temporarily

```
sudo iw reg set US
```

Note: Substitute your country code if you are not in the United States.

Set it permanently

```
sudo nano /etc/default/crda
```

Change the last line to read:

```
REGDOMAIN=US
```

### Recommendations regarding USB

- Moving your USB WiFi adapter to a different USB port has been known to fix a variety of problems.

- If connecting your USB WiFi adapter to a desktop computer, use the USB ports on the rear of the computer. Why? The ports on the rear are directly connected to the motherboard which will reduce problems with interference and disconnection.

- If your USB WiFi adapter is USB 3 capable and you want it to operate in USB3 mode, plug it into a USB 3 port.

- Avoid USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports if possible as almost all currently available adapters have been tested with USB 3.1 Gen 1 (aka USB 3) and not with USB 3.1 Gen 2.

- If you use an extension cable and your adapter is USB 3 capable, the cable needs to be USB 3 capable (if not, you will at best be limited to USB 2 speeds).

- Extention cables can be problematic. A way to check if the extension cable is the problem is to plug the adapter temporarily into a USB port on the computer.

- Some USB WiFi adapters require considerable electrical current and push the capabilities of the power available via USB port. One example is adapters that use the Realtek 8814au chipset. Using a powered multiport USB extension can be a good idea in cases like this.

### FAQ:

Question: What extended features does this driver support?

Answer: None. For extended features, you need an adapter that uses Mediatek or
Atheros drivers.

-----

Question: I bought two rtl8814au based adapters and am planning to use both in
the same computer. How do I set that up?

Answer: You can't without considerable technical skills.  Realtek drivers do not
support more than one adapter with the same chipset in the same computer. You
can have multiple Realtek based adapters in the same computer as long as the
adapters are based on different chipsets.

-----

Question: Why do you recommend Mediatek based adapters when you maintain this
repo for a Realtek driver?

Answer: Many new and existing Linux users already have adapters based on Realtek
chipsets. This repo is for Linux users to support their existing adapters but my
STRONG recommendation is for Linux users to seek out USB WiFi solutions based on
Mediatek,

https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi

-----

Question: Will you put volunteers to work?

Answer: Yes. Post a message in `Issues` or `Discussions` if interested.

-----

Question: I am having problems with my adapter and I use Virtualbox?

Answer: This [article](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/forum/wifi-hacking-attach-usb-wireless-adapter-with-virtual-box-0324433/) may help.

-----

Question: The driver installation script completed successfully and the
driver is installed but does not seem to be working. What is wrong?

Answer: Turn secure boot off to see if that allows the driver to work.
This driver is primarily tested on Debian based distros such as Ubuntu,
Raspberry Pi OS and Kali. In an attempt to make this driver work well on
many Linux distros, other distros, including the Arch based Manjaro is
used for testing. Currently I do not have installations of Fedora or
OpenSUSE available for testing and reply on user reports of success or
failure. I have two test systems with secure boot on so as to  test secure
boot. I have not seen any secure boot problems with Ubuntu based systems.

dkms is used in the installation script. It helps with a lot of issues that
will come up if a simple manual installation is used. dkms has the
capability to handle the needs of secure boot. dkms was written by and is
maintained by Dell. Dell has been offering some Ubuntu pre-loaded systems
for years so their devs likely test on Ubuntu. I suspect Fedora and
OpenSUSE may be handing their secure boot support differently than Debian
based systems and this is leading to problems. This and the other repos
I have are VERY heavily used and I am sure there are plenty of non-Debian
users that use this driver. Are they all turning off secure boot and not
reporting the problem? I don't know. What I do know is that reports like
this are rare.

For the driver to compile and install correctly but not be available
tells me there is likely a key issue. Here is an interesting link
regarding Debian systems and secure boot:

https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot

That document contains a lot of information that can help an investigation
into what the real problem is and I invite you and other Fedora, OpemSUSE
and users of other distros that show this problem to investigate and
present what you know to the devs of your distro via their problem
reporting system. Turning off secure boot is NOT a fix. A real fix needs
to happen.
